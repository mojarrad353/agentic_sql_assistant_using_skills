# Sales Analytics Schema

## Tables

### customers
- customer_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- name
- email
- signup_date
- status (active/inactive)
- customer_tier (bronze/silver/gold/platinum)

### orders
- order_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- customer_id (FOREIGN KEY -> customers)
- order_date
- status (pending/completed/cancelled/refunded)
- total_amount
- sales_region (north/south/east/west)

### order_items
- item_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- order_id (FOREIGN KEY -> orders)
- product_id
- quantity
- unit_price
- discount_percent

## Business Logic

**Active customers**: status = 'active' AND signup_date <= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days')

**Revenue calculation**: Only count orders with status = 'completed'. Use total_amount from orders table, which already accounts for discounts.

**Customer lifetime value (CLV)**: Sum of all completed order amounts for a customer.

**High-value orders**: Orders with total_amount > 1000

## Example Query

-- Get top 10 customers by revenue in the last quarter
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    c.customer_tier,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  AND o.order_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months')
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.customer_tier
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
